The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classification model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the target outcome based on features provided in the dataset. The dataset consists of structured data containing multiple independent variables that influence the final classification.

The project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions, relationships, and data quality issues. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features where required, and selecting relevant features for model training.

Since KNN is a distance-based algorithm, appropriate preprocessing techniques were applied to ensure meaningful distance calculations. The model was trained on the processed dataset and evaluated using a train–test split and K-Fold cross-validation to assess generalization performance and reduce overfitting.

This project demonstrates the application of the KNN algorithm on a real-world dataset, covering the complete machine learning workflow from data preparation to model evaluation.
